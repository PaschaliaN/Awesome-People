I recommend everyone read the following two art books,
"Steal Like An Artist" by Austin Kleon and "Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain" by Betty Edwards.
 The first book will help you be more creative in all areas of your life, regardless of whether you have a creative career.
 The second book will take you from being a stick figures artist to a "hey, that is an awesome person's face" artist.
 I highly recommended these books; they transformed my creative sensibilities.
